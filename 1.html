            All changelings possess unique shape-shifting magic. It enables them
            to shift form, voice, and even size with stunning rapidity and
            accuracy. They use this ability to fool their victims and drain
            their love, which is essential for their survival.

          <p class="margin-for-text">
            Also you don't have to forget about rearmament of the army. New gun
            is a new argument in the debates with the enemies. If you weapon is
            bigger, than your arguments will be louder.

            New tanks are better than old, but sometimes it's better to use
            older ones. Why? Ansew is simple: older tanks are cost less and they
            are more reliable because they don't have many equipment.

            New airplanes. Do not econom in the air defence! After Great War
            almost all countries will have nuclear weapon. Don't give them a
            chance to take air superiority if you don't want atomic bomb in you
            home.

            Espionage. There are 4 deployment sites: civilian government, army,
            navy and air force. For each implementation, the effects and bonuses
            are the same, with the exception of bonus effects that are possible
            with a successful outcome of the operation. When infiltrated into
            the administration, agents will try to get into the government by
            providing you with information about civil affairs in the country.
            When implemented in the Army, Navy and Air Force, the data will be
            on these sections of espionage, respectively. A bonus outcome could
            be gaining experience from one of the types of troops or political
            power.

            Counterintelligence is used to disrupt the work of enemy agents. The
            higher this value, the more likely it is that you will be able to
            stop other people's agents, and the more time and money it will take
            to carry out an operation against you. Just like any other methods
            of reconnaissance, they are carried out with the help of agents. For
            counterintelligence, one agent is enough to carry out the task while
            in your or an allied country.

            And don't forget: New enemies intelligence saves your soldiers from
            death and gives them new appartunities to live in piece after war.
